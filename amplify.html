    <!-- WHY AMPLIFY -->
    <section class="shift">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Why Amplify Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Discovery helps AI understand your business.  
                Radar helps AI understand your expertise.  
                <strong>Amplify puts that understanding to work.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Your AI Assistant can answer common questions, explain your services, handle inquiries,  
                provide pricing context, and guide prospects — 24/7 — using the knowledge you provide.

    <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
    <section class="what-it-does">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>What Amplify Does</h2>
            <p>
                Amplify combines your Discovery foundation and your Radar Custom GPT into a single Assistant  
                that represents your business accurately and professionally.
            </p>

            <p>
                When prospects ask questions, your AI Assistant responds with the information you've validated —  
                increasing clarity, reducing phone calls, and helping leads feel confident before they contact you.
