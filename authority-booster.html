            <h2>Why Authority Booster Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Discovery helps AI recognize your business.  
                Radar helps AI understand your expertise.  
                Amplify lets AI represent your business.  
                Duo keeps everything consistent and updated.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Authority Booster goes a step further:</strong> it spreads your structured, AI-ready data  
                across multiple trusted platforms, giving answer engines more independent places to confirm that  
                you are who you say you are — and that your information is reliable.
            </p>

    <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
    <section class="what-it-does">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>What Authority Booster Does</h2>
            <p>
                Instead of relying on a single AI-focused site or repository, Authority Booster publishes your  
                data to multiple code and data platforms that AI models frequently crawl and reference.
            </p>
            <p>
                When answer engines see the same, well-structured information repeated across these sources,  
                it becomes easier for them to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Verify your business exists.</li>
                <li>Confirm what you do and where you operate.</li>
                <li>Trust that your information is accurate and current.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
