                and easy for answer engines to understand over time.

            <h2>Why Duo Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Discovery helps AI recognize your business.  
                Radar helps AI understand your expertise.  
                Amplify lets AI represent your business.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Duo makes sure all of that stays consistent and active over time.</strong>  
                Instead of manually updating files and hoping AI notices, Duo automates key steps  
                so your AI visibility system stays fresh and aligned.

    <!-- WHAT DUO DOES -->
    <section class="what-it-does">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>What Duo Does</h2>
            <p>
                Duo uses structured workflows to publish and maintain your AI-focused site, generate and refresh  
                AI sitemaps, and keep your core information synced — so answer engines can continue to verify,  
                re-scan, and trust your business over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of “set it and forget it,” Duo gives you “set it, automate it, and keep it current.”
