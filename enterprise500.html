            <p>
                When your operation handles dozens or hundreds of businesses, you need more than a dashboard.  
                You need structure, stability, automation, and predictable processes that minimize friction and  
                maximize efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Enterprise 500 gives you that foundation.</strong>  
                A scalable architecture designed to manage large client loads without sacrificing clarity  
                or accuracy — backed by automation that keeps your visibility system aligned.
