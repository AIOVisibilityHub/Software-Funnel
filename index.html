                Customers don’t browse through pages of results anymore — they ask AI, and AI gives an answer.<br>
                Discovery helps ensure AI understands who you are, what you offer, and why you're the right choice.

            <p>
                AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, and others now answer real questions directly — not through links.
                Your business deserves to be part of those answers. Discovery gives you the foundation to make that happen without
                tech overwhelm, jargon, or guesswork.

        <h2>Why AI Visibility Matters Right Now</h2>
        <p>
            AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Claude now answer customer questions directly.
            People ask, “Who’s the best?”, “Who can help with…?”, and “What company does…?”
            — and AI responds instantly.
        </p>
        <p>
            If AI doesn’t clearly understand your business, your services, and your expertise,
            it simply recommends another business built into its knowledge base.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Discovery ensures your business is part of those answers — not left out of them.</strong>

            <h2>What Discovery Does</h2>
            <p>
                Discovery organizes your business information in the way AI understands best. You don’t need technical terms or special
                knowledge — AI can only recommend businesses it understands. Discovery helps AI understand you clearly and consistently.

    <!-- WHY THIS MATTERS -->
    <section class="why-matters">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>Your customers are already asking AI questions like:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>“Who can help me with ___?”</li>
                <li>“What company does ___ near me?”</li>
                <li>“Who is the best for ___?”</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If AI doesn’t understand your business, it will simply recommend someone else. Discovery ensures your business isn’t left out.</p>

        <h2>How Discovery Works</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. You add your core business details.</strong><br>
