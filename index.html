            <h2>Answer Engines Like ChatGPT Are Now Recommending Businesses</h2>
            <p>
                Ever since AI overviews started answering questions on Google, and AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, and others started answering questions directly — <i><b>approximately 40% of people are asking questions on these AI answer engines instead of the traditional Google searches.</b></i> <u>This number is increasing by the day.</u> In fact, ChatGPT is growing faster than Facebook!
                Your business deserves to be part of these answers, and included directly in conversations with your future clients. Our Discovery software gets you discovered in AI search by giving you the foundation to make that happen without
                tech overwhelm, jargon, or guesswork.  It is a simple, yet powerful, system and the beginning of AI visibility, so AI bots can recommend you to your prospects.

        <h2>Why Getting Discovered in AI Search Matters Right Now</h2>
        <p>
            AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Claude are answering your customers questions directly and making recommendations in your area.
            When people ask, “Who’s the best?”, “Who can help me with…?”, and “What company does…?”
            — AI responds instantly.
        </p>
        <p>
            If AI doesn’t clearly understand your business, your services, and your expertise,
            it simply recommends another business built into its knowledge base.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Our Discovery software ensures your business is included in those conversations as part of those answers — not left out of them.</strong>

            <h2>What the AIO Visibility Hub "Discovery" Level Software Actually Does</h2>
            <p>
                Discovery organizes your business information in the way AI understands best. You don’t need technical terms or special
                knowledge — AI can only recommend businesses it understands. Discovery helps AI understand you clearly and consistently.
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- WHY THIS MATTERS -->
    <section class="why-matters">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Why AI Discovery Matters</h2>
            <p>Your customers are already asking AI questions by speaking their questions or typing them into answer engines, like:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>“Who can help me with ___?”</li>
                <li>“What company does ___ near me?”</li>
                <li>“Who is the best for ___?”</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If AI doesn’t know or understand your business, it will simply recommend someone else. What most people don't realize is AI does not suddenly read all of the websies in the area of potential businesses. In fact, it doesn't even understand HTML. It can only include businesses in its conversations or recommend you if you are already in its knowledge base. Discovery ensures your business isn’t left out.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>How AIO Visibility Hub's Discovery Level Works</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. You simply add your core business details.</strong><br>
                We guide you through each aspect of what AI needs to understand your business fully and clearly.</li>

            <li><strong>2. Discovery structures your information into schema datasets and machine readable formatting so it is AI-ready.</strong><br>
                Clean, consistent, organized and structured data — formatted the way answer engines prefer so they can learn everything there is to know about your expertise.</li>

            <li><strong>3. Once AI discovers you (hence, the "discovery" phase), AI can now recognize, categorize, and reuse your information in its answers and conversations.</strong><br>
                See, when people ask AI questions, and AI answers, those questions are generally followed up with more questions and answers.  This becomes the foundation for our AI Discovery mode, which leads to Radar targeted, and Amplified levels, and deeper AI visibility across all the major AI answer engines.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Benefits of Discovery</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clarity for AI systems</strong> — you give answer engines the information they need to understand what you do.</li>
            <li><strong>Accuracy in recommendations</strong> — AI can explain your services clearly and answer your future clients' questions.</li>
            <li><strong>Visibility foundation</strong> — everything builds on this: Radar targeted, Amplified versions, and ultimately the Duo.</li>
            <li><strong>Future-proof positioning</strong> — your business is future-focused and ready for how AI recommends companies today.</li>
            <li><strong>Becoming Unique</strong> — providing more of your unique datapoints will set you apart with your own unique visibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Confidence & control</strong> — you aren’t left guessing what AI sees from the limited data it crawls about your business.</li>

        <h2>What Professionals Are Beginning to Realize</h2>
        <p>
            AI optimization for visibility across AI platforms is becoming the new standard — and early adopters are gaining an advantage.  AI visibility only enhances your SEO efforts and maximizes your exposure across AI search and voice search, i.e. "speakable" search results, as with Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and, on Windows and some devices, Microsoft’s Cortana. Once you are discovered by AI search, your information is included in these speakable voice search assistants, as well, which is a huge bonus compared to SEO alone.

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Is this SEO?</strong><br>
                No. SEO is for search engines. Discovery prepares your business for answer engines (AI systems that give direct responses).</li>

            <li><strong>Do I need technical skills?</strong><br>
                Not at all. We guide you step-by-step. Discovery is simple and structured.</li>

            <li><strong>Does this replace my website?</strong><br>
                No. It enhances your presence by helping AI interpret your information correctly.</li>

            <li><strong>How long does it take?</strong><br>
                Most businesses complete Discovery in under an hour.</li>

            <li><strong>Do I need to update it?</strong><br>
                You can — but Duo will automate future updates when you're ready for that level.</li>
