            <h2>Why Radar Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Discovery establishes who you are.  
                Radar establishes what you know.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your Custom Business GPT becomes the core source AI uses when answering deeper questions about  
                your services, qualifications, pricing structures, processes, benefits, and expertise.

    <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
    <section class="what-it-does">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>How Radar Works</h2>
            <p>
                You add your service details, expertise, differentiators, and FAQs. Radar structures them  
                so AI systems can scan, understand, and use that information when answering questions.
            </p>
            <p>
                This gives AI a far deeper understanding of your business than your website alone can provide.
